                        Hello! I'm Daniel Boren, a full stack web developer based in Austin, TX. My interests
                        include progressive rock, cute animals, and things working properly, and that includes
                        websites! Click the nav bar in the upper right to have a look at my past work and how 
                        to get in touch with me.
                    </p>
                </div>
